I was recently looking for internships on Internshala. At the beginning, I applied to 2-3 internships. Then I saw on Internshala that they say you have to apply to at least 15 internships to get a response from 1 employer. I was like, WTF! Applying for one internship takes me around 5 minutes—from finding the right one to writing a cover letter using ChatGPT, while mentioning my skills, projects, and other things in the cover letter. To make things worse, if there's any assignment in the application process, it takes around 7 to 10 minutes to apply to just one internship. So, I thought, what if I automate everything—from finding internships to updating my resume, writing the perfect cover letter, and even solving assignments—so I could relax and endlessly scroll through Instagram (which shows me depressing content and whose algorithm is getting way too personal day by day).

## Features
* You can apply to a single internship in less than 1 minute without touching your keyboard or mouse (or while scrolling Instagram).
* You can theoretically apply to unlimited internships at once.
* Automatic cover letter writing using ChatGPT and your personal resume, while targeting the internship's description and required skills.
* It will solve assignments that are below the cover letter using ChatGPT, while keeping your resume in mind.
* It will automatically add the required skills (mentioned in the internship description) to your Internshala resume.
* It checks if the assignment is easy enough to be solved by ChatGPT. If it asks for any personal info, it skips that internship and saves the cover letter so you can easily apply manually.
* Generates **beautiful**(like her) success/failed reports after applying to internships, so you can keep track of every application.
* Detects fake internships and filters them out. It automatically filters internships if any employer hasn't hired a single candidate till now and is just posting fake internships. It checks for employers' hiring and posting stats and their active history on Internshala.
